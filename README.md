In the tech world we are all wanting to make sure we always have a secure password to keep our information safe
    
The point of this activity was to show our skills and knowledge of what we have achieved with java, and all the other important things that go along with it to help push us to become greater. But even with all of our different backgrounds and experiences as we grow as people, shows how much we can come together to work as a team to try and learn new things, even things that you would never even imagine yourself doing.

    
This project was to show what I have learned in the past week with JAVA, and also what I have learned including HTML, and CSS. Even would say that learned a lot in my first four weeks in this of my research and cannot wait for what else is to come of this. I know there is so much more to learn and looking forward to learn whats next. Before this project, I have always wanted to code since I was young, but never have, so I don't really have much of any coding experience but I will definitely be improving.
